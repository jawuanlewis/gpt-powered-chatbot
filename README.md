## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or higher)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)

### Local Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawuanlewis/gpt-powered-chatbot.git
cd gpt-powered-chatbot
```

2. Install server dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install client dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Running the Application

You can run the client and server concurrently in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Run server only
npm run dev:server

# Run client only
npm run dev:client
```

### Building for Production

To build both client and server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or build them separately:

```bash
# Build server only
npm run build:server

# Build client only
npm run build:client
```

### Running in Production

After building, start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Code Quality

Format your code:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check code formatting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## ▶️ Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
2. Start a conversation by typing your message in the input box.
3. Press "Enter" or click the send button to receive a response from the assistant.
4. View existing conversations which will be displayed in the sidebar menu.
5. Use the sidebar to switch between or rename chat sessions.
6. Interact freely — the assistant is powered by the OpenAI GPT-4 API for high-quality responses.
